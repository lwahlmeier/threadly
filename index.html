        <p>A library of java tools to assist with development of concurrent java applications.  This is designed to be a complement to java.util.concurrent and uses 
        java.util.concurrent to help assist in it's implementations where it makes sense.</p>

        <p>These tools provide things ranging from the KeyDistributedExecutor which allows for threading to be controled, and portions of the application to be written 
        in a single threaded context.  To the unique priority based, high performance, thread pool.  To the ability to create a hierarchy of thready pools (sub pools 
        in threadly named "Limiters").  To the ability to control threading and allow things to easily run single threaded where it makes sense.  This library also 
        includes utilities for making it easier to unit test concurrent applications.  As well as utilities to help debug concurrent designs.</p>

  <p>To get a more complete overview of our features take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/wiki/Threadly-Features">features wiki page</a>.</p>

  <p><h3>News:</h3>
  <p>* April 7th - I am focused on getting the 4.0.0 release ready.  I am now excited for this release because I think it provides much better logic in the PriorityScheduler around low vs high priority tasks.  Becuase of that today we are releasing version 3.7.0, this version has no functional changes but just indicates a few things in the PrioritySchedulerStatisticTracker that will no longer be supported in 4.0.</p>
  <p>* March 27th - Released version 3.6.0 which only includes API changes in the PriorityScheduler/PrioritySchedulerStatisticTracker.  I have been convinced that having a automatically sized thread pool does not make sense for this library (at least without provided stricter goals).  So this includes API changes so that a transition to 4.X will be easier.  In 4.X we will still allow you to change the pool size manually while running, but the pool will no longer have a concept of a core/max size, and instead will use set sizes (which again can be adjusted at runtime).  I am now convinced that dynamically sized pools are more likely to cause more harm than good, and if we were to create a dynamically sized pool it would need to be smarter and more application specific (feel free to post your ideas as github issues).</p>
  <p>* March 17th - Released version 3.5.0 of threadly.  This is our 30th released version, and with it we crossed the 1000 commit mark!  It's been a long road for this project, and I plan to keep it going.  This release offers some minor inclusions of new features (like SchedulingUtils for calculating the initial delay to an absolute time, or a given hour offset), as well as some bug fixes (like fixing issues where threads can be leaked if the thread pool is allowed to be garbage collected).  Unfortunately these changes increased the jar size from 208KB to around 216KB.  I have always wanted to keep this library small but as features have been added it has been growing.  Luckily you don't HAVE to use all the features, and the implementation for any given feature has always been kept lite and fast.</p>
  <p>* Febuary 6th - Released bug fix version 3.4.1.  The two bugs fixed were not recent regressions, but were trivial to fix, and release.  Check the releases page on github for more information.  The javadocs were not updated due to having no API changes, you can use the 3.4.0 javadocs for version 3.4.1.</p>
  <p>* January 29th - Release of version 3.4.0, this is a MAJOR release for threadly.  The reason this release has taken so long to get out is because it had higher risk associated with it.  This release includes almost a complete redo of how jobs are queued inside of PriorityScheduler.  This results in a 5 to 15% performance improvement (closer to 15% for simple executions, 5% for scheduled and recurring tasks).  The only new/added feature is the addition of "TesablePriorityScheduler" to assist in testing code which needs an implementation of the PrioritySchedulerInterface.  I encourage you to look at the change log for more detailed information, particularly around the deprecations of DynamicDelayQueue, DynamicDelayedUpdater, and ConsumerIterator.  I also removed the hosting of javadocs for version 0.8 and 0.9.  Both versions are over a year old now, but the javadocs can still be found on the <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/releases">releases page on github</a>.</p>
  <p>* November 21st - One of the more significant releases in a while.  Version 3.3.0 has something for everyone, performance improvements in the NoThreadScheduler and SingleThreadScheduler (hopefully in the future we can take the lessons learned here to improve the PriorityScheduler further), minor bug fixes around ExceptionUtils.makeRuntime, and the PrioritySchedulerStatisticTracker.  But probably most interesting is some facilities to help with a completely new idea on how to do work asynchronously.  Instead of having to submit everything to a scheduler, and require the overhead of releasing the thread, and then getting it again for another task.  In some cases it can be much more efficient to chain the tasks together using the ListenableFuture design.  This is facilitated by a couple new classes "ChainedRunnableListenableFuture" (which can ensure that in a thread safe way the task is executed on the scheduler, even if the future completes before time of adding the listener), and "ClearOnGetSettableListenableFuture" (which can prevent the waste of holding on to large results, when they are no longer needed).</p>
  <p>* November 4th - A patch release of 3.2.1 was released today.  This fixes some small issues (none of which were recent regressions).  Primarily around not getting low priority tasks returned from PriorityScheduler.shutdownNow().</p>
  <p>* October 28th - A minor release of version 3.2.0 today.  This includes some small changes, but worthy enough to get them out sooner than later.  These changes are primarily around the NoThreadScheduler, and being able to control how Exceptions are thrown from tasks inside it.  It also has some minor code cleanup, and better usage of Exceptions within the schedulers.</p>
  <p>* October 21st - Released version 3.1.0.  This has a nice expansion in features offering scheduleAtFixedRate (as a complement to scheduleWithFixedDelay).  It also includes some bug fixes, as well as new functionality to the Clock class to handle conditions where the system clock has changed.  Look at the releases page on github for more details: <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/releases">https://github.com/threadly/threadly/releases</a>.</p>
  <p>* September 22nd - Just a few days after our 2.6.0 release, we now have 3.0.0 available.  The only changes in this release are the removals of deprecations which occurred in the 2.X version tree.</p>
  <p>* September 19th - Released version 2.6.0 today, and 3.0.0 is right around the corner.  The most important change in this release is our change in license.  With the support of all contributing developers we were able to switch to the less restrictive <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/">Mozilla Public License 2.0</a>.  The main motivation is in how our previous license prevented static linking (making it difficult to use in VM's like avian, or possibly as fat jars).  That was never the developers intention, we want anyone (proprietary or not) to be able to use threadly.  Our motivation in having a license is only that we want to encourage changes/updates/improvements to the library to be given back to the community.  This release is another huge step forward for this project.  It includes user improvements by dramatically better javadocs (better linking, formating, and some description clarifications).  As always read the <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/releases">changelog</a> for all the details.</p>
  <p>* August 18th - Released version 2.5.0 today.  This includes minor changes that I wanted to get released and available for others to use (as we are not quite ready for the 3.0.0 release yet).  Please see the <a href="h://github.com/threadly/threadly/releases">changelog</a> for details on the bug fixes and deprecations.</p>
  <p>* August 5th - Version 2.4.0 has been released as the current stable version.  This version has modest changes, but we are continuing to try to release frequently when we have a stable branch.  These changes are focused around other ways to handle error handling within threadly (No longer forcing you to use the UncaughtExceptionHandler, ExceptionUtils now offers several ways to handle asynchronous exceptions).  The other change is a new Future type which can start execution on .get() request if execution has not already begun.  This can be useful for tasks which need a result ASAP (and allows better thread usage as a thread no longer will be just blocked waiting on the .get() call).  There are other small changes, which you should check the <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/releases">changelog</a> for details on.</p>
  <p>* July 21st - Released version 2.3.0.  It's obviously only been about 2 weeks since the last release.  I know we frequently have been on a one month cadence, but that was really just by chance.  In general I just want to release once the build is ready and stable.  If we can keep the releases small, low risk, and semi-frequent, that's even better.  This release has a few very small defect fixes (arguments in constructors accidentally being ignored in PrioritySchedulerStatisticTracker and TaskSchedulerDistributor).  As well as a single deprecation to fix the spelling error in renaming ThrowableSurpressingRunnable to the correctly spelled ThrowableSuppressingRunnable.  The most major change is the build system.  The gradle wrapper is now included so that gradle does not need to be separately installed, and we have updated the build scripts to gradle 2.0.  All in all, steady progression in the project.</p>
  <p>* July 8th - Released version 2.2.0.  In this version we made improvements to our utilities for dealing with event driven, callback/listener based designs.  We ended up moving/renaming ListenerHelper to the new "event" package (the old one will still exist till 3.0.0).  Since we were already deprecating stuff for the event driven improvements, we decided to go ahead and rename the PriorityScheduledExecutor into the shorter named PriorityScheduler.  Again, it will continue to exist under the old name until the 3.0.0 release.  As always, please check the <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/releases">changelog</a> for a complete and detailed list for changes/improvements.</p>
  <p>* June 9th - Released version 2.1.0, this follows the patch release of 2.0.1.  We released version 2.0.1 to fix a bug found in NoThreadScheduler and SingleThreadScheduler where recurring tasks may be executed ahead of .execute or .submit tasks submitted while the task was running.  2.1.0 is mostly more bug fixes.  It does include some new features, most prominently is the improved shutdown logic around SingleThreadScheduler, which now has the ability to "shutdownNow".  In addition we improved some platform specific string formatting for the "Profiler", "DebugLogger" and "ExceptionUtils".  We want to continue to release frequently (once we know the code is stable and safe enough to do so), so I invite you to look at <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/releases">changelog</a> for more details.</p>
  <p>* May 27th - Major release of version 2.0.0 today!  This was not very long since our 1.3.0 release, but that is mostly because 2.0.0 had been in development in parallel for a couple months now.  This is a notable milestone for threadly.  We cleaned up our API quite a bit, and this includes some major advancements to maintainability for the code base going forward (particularly around unit tests).  There are not a ton of new features, but the biggest is the inclusion of the "SingleThreadScheduler".  Which is much lighter weight and faster than the PriortiyScheduledExecutor (but obviously can only work in a single threaded manner).  I recommend anyone checks the change log to see what api for the library has been removed, and how to update your projects (though you should already have an idea if your running 1.3.0 which has all removed API's marked as deprecated).</p>
  <p>* May 12th - Released version 1.3.0, which includes minor changes to the threadly project.  These are just a couple small changes that were easy to include in the 1.0.0 series of releases.  This will likely be the last 1.0.0 series of releases before 2.0.0, the only exception would be if any bugs are found.  There are no significant bug fixes or feature improvements in this release, as new features and improvements have been focused on the 2.0.0 release.</p>
  <p>* April 14th - Released version 1.2.0.  This includes some nice performance improvements around the TaskExecutorDistributor and the TaskSchedulerDistributor.  This also includes an expansion around our utilities around Future's/ListenableFuture's.  Otherwise this release is primarily doing some cleanup and starting to think about what we want to accomplish in our 2.0.0 release.  Some things have started migrating to some new api's.  We will probably start publishing a 2.0.0 artifact in the next couple of weeks.</p>
  <p>* March 19th - Released version 1.1.0, which includes a small expansion of the feature set.  This includes new tools like ListenableFutureResult, and ListenerHelper (which is a great tool for handling callbacks).  It also has some code and performance improvements around the thread pool limiters (aka sub pools).  Please look at the <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/releases">changelog</a> for more details.</p>
  <p>* February 10th - Released version 1.0.0 of threadly.  This release is very exciting to me as it indicates a new level for the project.  A new level of stability and maturity, a new level of control and openness.  As in my previous post you will note that we removed and changed a lot more than we originally expected to.  I felt this was important because with the 1.0.0 release a lot of changes are occurring.  A stricter versioning is part of this, allowing people to easily know what level of risk and change is included in every version (as described <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/wiki/Version-Guide">here on the wiki</a>).  We also plan to provide more visibility through pull requests, and filed issues into what exactly has changed (though the change log has always been very complete).  We had lots of things in the 0.9 release we decided to remove for 1.0.0 because we felt that they added a lot of complexity, and code, when their value was minimal at best.  Because it will be harder to remove those things in the future we decided now is the time to do it.  So they have been removed, but can be easily added back if others find any of those features useful (they were removed because no one was using them and we saw minimal reason someone would start using them).  Please look at the <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/releases">changelog</a> for a more complete list of what has changed.</p>
